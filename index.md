## Welcome To The Rending
This setting has been in development for a very long time. It began as a kind of Dark Water rip off, where a Pangea like continent broke a part into thousands of small island chains and a mysterious dark water was creeping North, threatening to consume everything. Magic was evil and physically transformed those that used it.

Jump ahead another 10 years and I had a thought. What if they were not islands, but the entire world broke a part? What if the sea was space? And what if the creeping dark water was in facd a horde of space daemons? Hell yeah. 


I've always enjoyed TTRPG settings that embraced not just fantasy elements but science-fiction elements as well. Let ancient civilizations not just be old, but nearly alien with wild technology. Let travel to space be an option! There are some great JRPGs where the final boss is on the friggin' moon. I wanted to embrace that.

Add on top of that some religious trauma by questioning the nature of dieties, the divine, magic, and baby you've got yourself a stew.

I hope you enjoy reading *The Rending of Palaghast* and please if you have any ideas or discover some issues with the setting send an email to [info@whensuddenly.games](mailto:info@whensuddenly.games).
