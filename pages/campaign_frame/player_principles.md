*If you decide to play this campaign, give the following information to your players.*
## Explore The World
There are secrets buried deep and covered over by the Rending, lost to time and destruction. What was the nature of Palaghast? Where did the Demiurge come from? Prior to the Rending there was only one ancestry, who were they and why are there so many now? Explore these ancient ruins and uncover more hidden truths.
## Question Your Reality
Consider that what you’ve been told and who it is that’s telling it to you. Perhaps not everything is as it seems. Are the New Gods evil? Do the Exemplars have your best interests in mind? What is the nature of the Abyssal Sea and the deamons within it.
## Shoot For The Stars
The Abyssal Sea is more than just a place “out there.” It is a place characters to strive to get to and learn more about. There is knowledge there that’s been lost to time and the firmaments.
