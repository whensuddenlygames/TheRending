*Keep the following guidance in mind while you GM this campaign.*
## The Past Is Catching Up
Try as they might, the Exemplar are unable to hide the true nature of reality from the mortal realm. The rise of New Gods and the pressure from the Abyssal Sea are threatening to uncover ancient secrets best left hidden. Lay out bread crumbs that lead to major revelations to the world that subvert what everyone believes to be true.
## Divine Doesn’t Mean Good
The Exemplar and the New Gods are not always good. Each are flawed beings with imperfect knowledge, who may believe they are doing right. Or, some may intentionally be cruel in the name of “righteousness.” Look for opportunities to pit Exemplar against one another or have the gods give the characters tasks that are dubious at best, or out right evil.
## Get Them To Space
An end-game goal is getting the players out to the Abyssal Sea to explore decaying locations, locked in stasis. Treat the Abyssal Sea not as our reality, but as a quasi-space realm that is breathable but otherworldly in nature. The daemons are a twisted form of reality and therefore do not fully comprehend what a vessel “should” look like. They are alien in thought and should represent that.
