## Divine Magic versus Abyssal Magic
Before the Rending there was only divine gifts granted to worshipers by Palaghast. Any supernatural power was considered divine in origin. Only after the Demiurge did the idea of magic other than a gift from a divine source emerge. 

Wizards and Sorcerers, primarily those who worship Scio, practice a type of divine magic wherein the knowledge to cast spells is granted to them by an Exemplar. Those who stray outside of these teachings, flirt with Abyssal magic. This type of magic claims to be drawn from within a mortal’s own life force, or tapping into some evil within the Abyssal Sea.
## Corrupted Domains
During the war between Palaghast and the Demiurge, several magical domains were forever corrupted. Dark secrets were whispered to divine wizards, who introduced new magical theorems designed to lead others down a path to accepting and practicing Abyssal magic.
## Reliquaries
Each landmass floating within the Abyssal Sea is called a Reliquary. Individually they are named after their respective Exemplar. To help distinguish the Reliquary from the Exemplar, mortals append the prefix Pala- to the name.
### A Silver Lining
At the edge of each Reliquary is a silver lining of light from the Heart of Palaghast. This provides a type of shimmering twilight. Here here firmament is also the thinnest, allowing viewers to view a vast expanse of stars.
#### The Firmament
Each Reliquary is protected by a divine firmament, a dome of power, that prevents daemons from entering. Though mortals have found ways of bypassing the firmament through summoning rituals or other dark means to circumvent this barrier. It is said that the Exemplars have made the firmament such that it prevents mortals from seeing the vast hosts of daemons that swirl just beyond it.
### Astral Bridges
Only through the use of Astral Bridges, divine gates that rest on the edge of the Reliquaries, can a mortal travel from one location to another. These are rigid locations with specifically paired gates. The bridges are connected as such:

* Pala-Arbar is connected to Pala-Vivo, Pala-Iluz, Pala-Lum, and Pala-Graco.
* Pala-Graco is connected to Pala-Arbar and Pala-Lum
* Pala-Iluz is connected to Pala-Arbar and Pala-Scio
* Pala-Lukton is connected to Pala-Malseren and Pala-Vivo.
* Pala-Lum is connected to Pala-Arbar, Pala-Scio, and Pala-Graco.
* Pala-Malseren is connected to Pala-Scio and Pala-Lukton.
* Pala-Morto has no Astral Bridges, rather one may travel to it through the Underworld.
* Pala-Scio is connected to Pala-Malseren and Pala-Lum.
* Pala-Vivo is connected to Pala-Lukton and Pala-Arbar
