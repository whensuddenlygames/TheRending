>The planet has been sundered into seven celestial bodies known as Reliquaries, held together by a divine light known as the “Heart of Palaghast.” Exemplars, living Relics of the dead god Palaghast now rule what's left. Beyond the firmaments that protect the Reliquaries swirls the Abyssal Horde, daemons who seek the final destruction of the world. While minor deities have arisen wielding self-directed divine power, drawing heretical adherents to their side.
