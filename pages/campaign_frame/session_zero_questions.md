*Ask any of these questions to your players, or make your own.*

* How does your character view the relationship between magic (even divine magic) and the supernatural gifts of other beings?
* You have personally witnessed a New God's divine power, what was it and how did it make you feel?
* A member of your family was born Abyssal Touched, how did the rest of the family react?
* You've heard a rumor that a Temple of Palaghast, built before the Rending, was uncovered nearby. Has anyone investigated it? What did they find if they did?
