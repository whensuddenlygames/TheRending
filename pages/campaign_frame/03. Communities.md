*All Communities are available, but a few are more likely to show up in certain Reliquaries. In addition there is one new community, the Abyssalborne.*

### Abyssalborne
Across all the Reliquaries you will find communities of Abyssalborne. Those who wish to play Abyssal Touched may wish to play a Abyssalborne character as this community consists of found families, families of Abyssal Touched, and those (a stupid word I can’t remember right now) of their plight.

* Did you find yourself properly born into this community?
* Are you an outsider, thrust into an unknown community outside of your control?
* Did you dabble in Abyssal Magic and now seek refuge among those who understand?

If you pick the Abyssalborne Community, take this feature.
*Being part of of an abyssalborne community means you are a part of a community who can be mistrusted by others for your assumed connection to daemons.*

**One With Magic:** You have advantage on understanding magical sigils and incants connected to the Abyss.
