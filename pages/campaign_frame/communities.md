*All Communities are available, but a few are more likely to show up in certain Reliquaries. In addition there is one new community, the Abyssalborne.*

## Abyssalborne

[Download Cards](files/Abyssal Cards.zip){: .btn}

Across all the Reliquaries you will find communities of Abyssalborne. Those who wish to play [Abyssal Touched](ancestries.md#abyssal-touched) may wish to play an Abyssalborne character. This community consists of found families, families of all Abyssal Touched, and those sympathetic to their plight.

* Did you find yourself properly born into this community?
* Are you an outsider, thrust into an unknown community outside of your control?
* Did you dabble in Abyssal Magic and now seek refuge among those who understand?

If you pick the Abyssalborne Community, take this feature.
*Being part of an abyssalborne community means you are a part of a community who can be mistrusted by others for your assumed connection to daemons.*

**Natural Affinity:** You have advantage on understanding magical sigils and incants connected to the Abyss.
