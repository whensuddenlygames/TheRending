## Cut Off
Exemplar of Splendor, Vivo has declared themselves the Exemplar Above All. This has created a rift among the Exemplar resulting in the rumblings of war. Lukton, Exemplar of Blade, has been the most vocal, repudiating the claim and calling for a censoring of Vivo and those that have thrown their support behind him. Rumors swirled that Lukton has begun to muster soldiers at Astral Gates connecting their Reliquaries. 

One early morning, the gates exploded, cutting off Pala-Lukton from everyone. The gates at Pala-Malseren and Pala-Vivo now lay in ruin. Who destroyed the gate? What will happen to Pala-Lukton now that it has been completely severed from the other Reliquaries? Can the bridge be repaired?

## A Slain Exemplar
Tensions among the Exemplar, Clanks, and New Gods have finally boiled over into a major conflict in Pala-Malseren. Conflicting rumors spread across the Reliquaries about what exactly happened and who was ultimately responsible. But this is known for sure; a sizable force laid siege to the captain city of Gale. A host broke into the throne room of Malseren and through some act beyond comprehension were able to slay the Exemplar.

The Nine Reliquaries shake, priests of Malseren drop to their knees unable to feel their connection to their god, and stranger still is that the Heart of Palaghast seemed to grow brighter.

Who killed Malseren? Will they be reformed? Why is the heart brighter? Will Malseren priests turn to abyssal magic to have power once more?
