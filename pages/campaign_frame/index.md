This is just a slice of the setting that has been in some form of development for nearly 10 years. To keep in the spirit of a Daggerheart Campaign Frame, I have purposefully left out a lot of setting specific names, maps, and NPCs. What you'll find within this frame is enough information to get you started and able to expand on the world and story your table wishes to tell. 

The most extensive addition to this frame comes with the [Abyssal Domain](campaign_mechanics#abyssal-domain). Unique among the official domains, this one may be picked up by *any* class at *any* time during a level up in place of their normal choices. It is very much a narrative driven domain. A player may not have set out to have cards in their loadout from it, but due to story reasons could feel compelled to do so.

I hope you enjoy The Rending of Palaghast.
