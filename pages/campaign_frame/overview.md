*One-Page overview of the setting*

In the beginning Palaghast, the god-planet, was whole and the People were happy. Until the Demiurge, a devious summoner and crafter corrupted [divinity](distinctions.md#divine-magic-versus-abyssal-magic). The People flirted with this new power that could rival Palaghast's. A war of the Divine and Abyss waged across the face of the world. The First Saints, anointed by Palaghast themself, took the fight directly to the Demiurge for a final killing blow. In their pitched battle, the Demiurge unleashed a decisive spell—an abyssal spear thrust straight through the breast of Palaghast. 

The god, and the world were sundered. 

Eight celestial bodies, [Reliquaries](distinctions.md#the-reliquaries), now float within the [Abyssal Sea](distinctions.md#abyssal-sea), held together by the silvery tendrils of light known as the “Heart of Palaghast.” The People are no more, now warped and scattered across the Reliquaries. Nine heavenly [Exemplars](distinctions.md#exemplar), living Relics birthed from Palaghast's death, arrived to lead, subjugate, or nurture. For a millennia the Exemplars worked to stave off the Abyssal Horde, daemons of the Abyssal Sea, which threaten to breach the firmament of Palaghast’s Final Grace. 

Unfortunately, the personal goals of the Exemplars became their primary concerns. They have turned to infighting among themselves for supreme control. Some still await for Palaghast to revive, others believe the god is dead, gone, and they the rightful rulers of these god’s floating corpse. All the more worrisome, [minor beings](distinctions.md#the-new-gods) wielding self-directed divine power have also drawn adherents to their side. Many have been crushed by the Exemplars as the heretics they are, while others have dug deep roots, unbound by any one Reliquary. 

Do you seek the return of Palaghast? Or do you side with the Exemplar? Perhaps these new gods are the future…. or do you wish to count yourself among their number?

Then again, what treasure and adventures await you within the depths of the Abyssal Seas.
