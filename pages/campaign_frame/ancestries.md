While all ancestries can be found throughout the broken world, some are more associated with one particular Reliquary than another. That said, the Aetheris, Clank, Infernis, and newly introduced Abbysal Touched have unique origins to this setting. 

## Aetheris
The most rare among the ancestries, the Aetheris are called “Children of the Exemplars.” While not true offspring, a percentage of children born within a Reliquary are born as aetheris. It is hypothesized that being in such close proximity of the Exemplar can bless those born to demonstrate divine powers.
## Clank
Before the Rending, Clanks were crafted by the armies of the Demiurge as machines of war. Fighters, cooks, laborers, they touched every part of the fight against Palaghast. It had been assumed they were all destroyed during the Rending. But that was far from the case. Excavations into mountains for resources uncovered vast caches of dormant Clank. After careful study by Scio scholars, they were successful in turning the Clanks back on. Amazed they discovered them to be fully autonomous.
## Infernis
In the darkest of times a mortal will reach out in prayer for an intervention, but what answers may not be what they expected. An Infernis is a mortal who has made an abyssal pact with a daemon, offering the creature something of themselves and in return a portion of that daemon’s power.
## Abyssal Touched
Like the Aetheris, there are those that become “touched” by the Abyss itself. These mortals exhibit the same physical transformations as those who practice Abyssal Magic while gaining new abilities tied to the Abyss. It is unknown who will become touched or who may be born with it. For all purposes it is as random as where a drop of rain may fall.

*One With Magic* You may select an Abyssal Domain card to replace another one of your class domain cards at character creation.

*Abyssal Shield:* Spend 3 Hope to halve damage from an Abyssal source.

*Abyssal Touched are recognizable by their white hair, purple eyes, and second opposable thumb that grows below their pinky finger.*

Casting abyssal spells can also begin to change the physiology of those who meddle with this forbidden magic. With those who have abyssal domain cards in their loadout show signs as follows:
- 1 card, their irises turn purple.
- 2 cards, purple irises and hair begins to turn white.
- 3 cards, fully white hair and purple irises, second thumb begins growing.
- 4 cards, fully transformed.
