While all ancestries can be found throughout the broken world, some are more associated with one particular Reliquary than another. That said, the Aetheris, Clank, Infernis, and newly introduced Abbysal Touched have unique origins to this setting. 

## Aetheris
The most rare among the ancestries, the Aetheris are called “Children of the Exemplars.” While not true offspring, a percentage of children born within a Reliquary are born as aetheris. It is hypothesized that being in such close proximity of the Exemplar can bless those born to demonstrate divine powers.

When choosing to play an Aetheris, consider which [Reliquary](distinctions.html#the-reliquaries) your character was born. How does this fact show itself in your features or actions?
## Clank
Before the Rending, Clanks were crafted by the armies of the Demiurge as machines of war. Fighters, cooks, and laborers they touched every part of the conflict. It had been assumed they were all destroyed during the Rending, but that was far from the case. Modern day excavations into mountains for resources uncovered vast caches of dormant Clank. After careful study by Scio scholars, they were successful in turning the Clanks back on. While they were expected to return to their duties as engines of war, the Clanks instead turned to pursue their own goals in life as autonomous beings.
## Infernis
In the darkest of times a mortal will reach out in prayer for an intervention, but what answers may not always be divine. An Infernis is a mortal who has made an abyssal pact with a daemon, offering the creature something of themselves and in return a portion of that daemon’s power. Infernis are never born, they are always a result of a pact made with a daemon.
## Abyssal Touched
Like the Aetheris, there are those that become “touched” by the Abyss itself. They are instantly recognizable by distinct features. It is unknown who will become touched or who may be born with it. For all purposes it is as random as where a drop of rain may fall.

This ancestry can be taken fully or as a mixed ancestry as normal. If chosen as a full ancestry, you should still pick an ancestry for your physical traits. You may appear as a Katari, but be fully Abyssal Touched.

*Abyssal Touched are recognizable by their white hair, purple eyes, and second opposable thumb that grows below their pinky finger.*

***One With Magic:*** You may select an [Abyssal Domain](campaign_mechanics.html#abyssal-domain) card to replace another one of your class domain cards at character creation.

***Abyssal Shield:*** **Spend 3 Hope** to halve damage from an Abyssal source.
