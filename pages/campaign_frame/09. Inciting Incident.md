## Cut Off
Exemplar of Splendor, Vivo has declared themselves the Exemplar Above All. This has created a rift among the Exemplar resulting in the rumblings of war. Lukton, Exemplar of Blade, has been the most vocal, repudiating the claim and calling for a censoring of Vivo and those that have thrown their support behind him. Rumors swirled that Lukton has begun to muster soldiers at Astral Gates connecting their Reliquaries. 

One early morning, the gates exploded, cutting off Pala-Lukton from everyone. The gates at Pala-Malseren and Pala-Vivo now lay in ruin. Who destroyed the gate? What will happen to Pala-Lukton now that it has been completely severed from the other Reliquaries? Can the bridge be repaired?
