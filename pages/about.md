# Welcome to the online document for **The Rending of Palaghast** 
This is a living document and repository for the development for the Daggerheart Campaign Frame.

## Why use Github?
For one, it makes updating the game far easier than trying to release a PDF every few months. This was demonstrated to me by my great friend Penny who first tried out this method with her game [Distorted Domains](http://transtapir.games/Distorted-Domains/). Second, it is in keeping with the spirit of open gaming systems. As a github repository you can just as easily grab a copy for yourself and begin tinkering with the mechanics and write your own ideas.

{: .note }
> You can't copyright mechanics anyway so it's not worth trying to gate keep them. I only "own" the expression of those mechanics.

## What Are My Goals?
I've been sitting on this setting for many years and it has gone through seveal changes. It began as a D&D 5e setting I ran for my friends. Because of that fact many of its core setting ideas were heavily rooted in that system. Most notably in the fact that the Reliquaries (then known as Domains) were based on the 8 D&D clerical domians. Moving into Daggerheart, this needed a bit of an overhaul, but not by much. All-in-all the spirit of the setting has remained largely the same.

So what is my goal? To breath new life into this setting and to share it with a larger audience. One that may find the push and pull between the divine and arcane as interesting as I do.

## Want To Help?
Two ways you can help. First is by giving your feedback! Send me an [email](mailto:info@whensuddenly.games) with anything you think about the frame, what you've discovered reading it, or how you feel when you've played it. Creating a new Domain, Community, and Ancestry isn't a simple task and definitely one I won't get right at first blush. I know it will need tweaking so any help is appreciated.

Second is through your financial support. Any amount of money frees me up to put more focus on this game's development, along with putting it toward the future final development of a full setting book should it come to that. Crowdfunding takes time and money so anything up front helps a ton. Consider heading over to my [Ko-Fi page](https://ko-fi.com/whensuddenlygames) to help out.
